# 🛠️ **React-Redux/toolkit + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL Full Stack Application**


### This repository contains a full-stack web application built using React for the frontend, Redux for state management, and Spring Boot for the backend, with PostgreSQL as the database.

     - frontend |  # React-Redux/toolkit application




## 📦 Frontend (React-Redux)

### The frontend is built with React and Redux to manage the application's state. It provides a modern, interactive user interface for interacting with the backend API.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- React: Single Page Application (SPA) using React.
- Redux: State management with Redux for global application state.
- Axios: For making API requests to the backend.
- React Router: For client-side routing and navigation.

  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- React
- Redux/toolkit
- React Router
- Axios

  
## 🔧 Backend (Spring Boot)

### The backend is a Spring Boot REST API that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to handle data and business logic. It provides endpoints for the frontend.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Spring Boot: RESTful API architecture.
- PostgreSQL: Database for persistent data storage.
- Spring Data JPA: For seamless database integration.
- Spring Security: For securing endpoints (if applicable).

  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security (optional)


## 🔗 API Endpoints

| Method   | Endpoint         | Description                  |
|----------|------------------|------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/api/resource`   | Get a list of resources       |
| `POST`   | `/api/resource`   | Create a new resource         |
| `PUT`    | `/api/resource`   | Update an existing resource   |
| `DELETE` | `/api/resource`   | Delete a resource             |


## 🔧 Connecting Frontend and Backend

Make sure the frontend is configured to make API requests to the backend running at `http://localhost:8080`. You can configure this in the frontend by updating the base URL used in API requests.

**Example (using Axios):**

```javascript
baseURL = 'http://localhost:8080';
```


## 🚀 Running the Application

1. Start the backend server (Spring Boot).
2. Start the frontend server (React).
3. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to interact with the application.
