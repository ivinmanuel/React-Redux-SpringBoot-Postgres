Frontend (React-Redux/Toolkit)

The frontend is built with React and Redux to manage the application's state. It provides a modern, interactive user interface for interacting with the backend API.

Key Features:-
React: Single Page Application (SPA) using React.
Redux/toolkit: State management with Redux for global application state.
Axios: For making API requests to the backend.
React Router: For client-side routing and navigation.

Technologies Used : React, Redux/toolkit, React Router, Axios


Backend (Spring Boot)

The backend is a Spring Boot REST API that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to handle data and business logic. The backend provides endpoints for the frontend to interact with.

Key Features:-
Spring Boot: RESTful API architecture.
PostgreSQL: Database for persistent data storage.
Spring Data JPA: For seamless database integration.
Spring Security: For securing endpoints (if applicable).

Technologies Used: Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security (optional)
